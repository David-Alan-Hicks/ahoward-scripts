Each host runs multiple backup tasks per day.  This message lists each host that had at least one task fail, followed by a list of all that host's tasks that did fail.  Hosts with no failures are not listed, and tasks that succeeded are not listed.

The easy way to do this is like so:
# debug.sh tid:657291
That will drop you into a 'less' session with only the relevant log entries

Format of this email is as follows:
(Hostname):  (tid:TaskID) (tid:TaskID) ...

`/root/r1soft-error-report.sh`
