# Apache only loads shared objects once, but every child process will 
# report memory as if it loaded the object itself. This means every process 
# is going to over-report its resident memory usage. This means you could 
# have a 4GB system that appears to have 6GB RAM in-use by apache. There's 
# no known way to get a precise value of actual RAM used by an apache 
# process (if you know one, please lodge a git issue).
# However, since the error is on both sides of the division, it cancels out. 
# This means the error only comes into effect in calculating how many 
# processes will use up the remaining, unused RAM, which means we'll err on 
# the side of caution by setting the value too low.  The estimate gets more 
# accurate as apache claims more RAM.
# Also note, the script has been updated to support multiple apache 
# instances on a single server. Each instance calculates its own MaxClients 
# value completely unaware of the other instance configurations, save for 
# the memory currently in use by those instances. If they were aware of each 
# other, I'd have to give MaxClients recommendations as a function of the 
# other, and it wouldn't make sense to any techs using the script.  This 
# almost never actually comes into effect.  In 99% of cases, there's only 
# one apache instance.
